# Even-Odd-Checker
The Even/Odd Checker is a beginner-friendly PHP project designed to practice form handling and conditional statements. Users can enter only numeric values through an input field and click a check button to determine whether the number is even or odd. The result is displayed inside a paragraph tag without page redirection. This project helps in understanding PHP form submission, operators, and basic validation.
